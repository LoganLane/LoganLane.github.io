excerpt: 'The ability to collaborate with other people across barriers created by time and/or space is one of the greatest features of modern communication. Immersive technologies are positioned to enhance this ability to collaborate even further. However, we do not have a firm understanding of how specific immersive technologies, or components thereof, alter the ability for two or more people to communicate, and hence collaborate.'

The ability to collaborate with other people across barriers created by time and/or space is one of the greatest features of modern communication. Immersive technologies are positioned to enhance this ability to collaborate even further. However, we do not have a firm understanding of how specific immersive technologies, or components thereof, alter the ability for two or more people to communicate, and hence collaborate. In this work-in-progress position paper, we propose a new framework for immersive collaboration experiences and provide an example of how it could be used to understand a hybrid collaboration among two co-located users and one remote user. We are seeking feedback from the community before conducting a formal evaluation of the framework. We also present some future work that this framework could facilitate.
