Hello! I'm Logan Lane. I'm currently in my third year as a PhD student at Virginia Tech, and conducting augmented and virtual reality research under the guidance of [Dr. Doug Bowman](https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/3digroup/author/dbowman/). I am a member of the [3D Interaction Group](https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/3digroup/) and the [Center for Human-Computer Interaction](https://hci.icat.vt.edu) at Virginia Tech.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Management and Information Systems from [The University of Virginia's College at Wise](https://www.uvawise.edu), with minors in Computer Science and Business Administration. It's been an exciting journey so far!

My research lies in the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Augmented and Virtual Reality, and collaboration. I am currently working on prototyping collaborative AR/VR experiences using Unity and Photon Networking technologies.
