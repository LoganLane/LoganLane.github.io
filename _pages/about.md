Hello! My name is Logan Lane. I am a third year PhD student at Virginia Tech and am advised by [Dr. Doug Bowman](https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/3digroup/author/dbowman/). I am a member of the [3D Interaction Group](https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/3digroup/) and the [Center for Human-Computer Interaction](https://hci.icat.vt.edu) at Virginia Tech.

Prior to attending Virginia Tech, I received my Bachelor's of Science in Management and Information Systems with minors in Computer Science and Business Administration from [the University of Virginia's College at Wise](https://www.uvawise.edu). 

My research lies in the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Augmented and Virtual Reality, and collaboration. I am currently working on prototyping collaborative VR/AR experiences using Unity and Photon Networking technologies.
