I developed a VR application that allowed a clinician and client to use VR as a therapy tool for social pragmatic training for individuals with autism. Clients were in a variety of simulated social contexts (e.g., classroom, pool, bowling alley, etc.) in which the clinician and client completed different therapy exercises inside of the virtual environments. Clinicians could reward clients with "coins" to allow them to play different games within a specific virtual environment as a reward for meeting criteria in targeted therapy exercises. 

This project was conducted in collaboration with [Dr. Diane Millar](https://www.radford.edu/content/wchs/home/cosd/about/faculty.html) and [Emilee Lane (My Wife :))](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilee-helbert/) as part of Emilee's master's thesis. Her thesis (and the results from this study) can be found [here](http://wagner.radford.edu/1115/1/Lane_Thesis_FINAL.pdf).
