I envisioned and developed a project simulating what Sony's official implementation of a VR trophy room might look like on the PlayStation VR 2 platform.

Utilizing JSON files obtained from Sony's PSN backend through this [API](https://andshrew.github.io/PlayStation-Trophies/#/) documented by andshrew, users can explore their actual trophy collection. They can select a game from a menu, and the system dynamically spawns the corresponding trophies they have earned. By pointing their controller's ray at a specific trophy, users can summon it, enabling them to view it in 3D space. Each trophy's appearance includes its icon, description, and the date it was earned, adding to the immersive experience.
