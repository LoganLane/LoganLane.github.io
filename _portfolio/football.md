This prototype, developed during a data visualization course, makes use of game data supplied by the NFL through the [Big Data Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023). Highlighting various passing plays from the 2021 season, I've mapped player positions over individual plays, enabling users to explore all passing sequences in a selected game. My system vividly illustrates passes and quarterback runs by sketching arcs and lines that shows player and ball movements. Simulating augmented reality within virtual reality, I've designed a conference room setting with a virtual football field displayed on the conference table.

I argued in class that an innovative tool like this has immense potential for coaches and players, potentially revolutionizing the way football teams analyze game footage.
