This program was developed to examine how aiding users at the beginning of a collaborative session might influence the overall collaboration experience. This software is also the basis for a currently unpublished paper that will be published in the near future.

The program allows two users to establish a shared whiteboard with one another using various initialization techniques. This collaboration software simulates remote, AR collaboration between two users in virtual reality. We do this by putting each user in a seperate environment and allowing the users to work with one another to establish a shared whiteboard. 

The software was developed using Unity and Photon PUN 2. More information will be posted about this project after the publishing of our paper.
