This program was created in support of a currently unpublished research paper that looks at the effects assisting the user during the start of a collaboration session can have on the collaboration experience as a whole. 

The program allows two users to establish a shared whiteboard with one another using one of three initialization techniques. This collaboration software simulates remote, AR collaboration between two users in virtual reality. We do this by putting each user in a seperate environment and allowing the users to work with one another to establish a shared whiteboard. 

The software was developed using Unity and Photon PUN 2. More information will be published on this project after the publishing of our paper.
